/**
 * Helper to resolve a workflow file path relative to the current module's URL.
 *
 * Useful when using ES modules (`import.meta.url`) to locate workflow files.
 * The `relativePath` should include the file extension explicitly (e.g. `./workflows.js`)
 * to ensure the resolved path is unambiguous in both source and built contexts.
 *
 * @param baseURL - The base URL to resolve from, typically `import.meta.url`
 * @param relativePath - Relative path to the workflows file, **including extension**
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { workflowsPathFromURL } from '@temporal-contract/worker/worker';
 *
 * const worker = await createWorker({
 *   contract: myContract,
 *   connection,
 *   // Include the extension explicitly to work in both source (.ts) and build (.js) contexts
 *   workflowsPath: workflowsPathFromURL(import.meta.url, './workflows.js'),
 *   activities,
 * });
