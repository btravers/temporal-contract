# Samples

> Complete working examples demonstrating temporal-contract

## Available Samples

### 📦 [order-processing-worker](./order-processing-worker)

Standard Promise-based worker with Clean Architecture

### 📦 [order-processing-worker-boxed](./order-processing-worker-boxed)

Result/Future pattern worker with explicit error handling

### 📦 [order-processing-client](./order-processing-client)

Standalone client demonstrating interaction with the unified contract

**Note**: The `order-processing-worker` and `order-processing-worker-boxed` samples share a unified contract. Both workers implement the same contract (`orderProcessingContract`) but with different internal implementations. The client sample works with either worker implementation seamlessly.

## Running Samples

```bash
# Start Temporal server
temporal server start-dev

# Install and build from repository root
cd ../..
pnpm install && pnpm build

# Run a worker (choose one)
cd samples/order-processing-worker
pnpm dev  # Terminal 1

# Run the client (in another terminal)
cd samples/order-processing-client
pnpm dev  # Terminal 2
```
