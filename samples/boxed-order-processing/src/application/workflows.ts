/**
 * Process Order Workflow Implementation
 *
 * This workflow demonstrates a different approach to error handling:
 * - Activities use Result/Future pattern in their implementation (domain + infrastructure)
 * - Workflow checks activity results and returns appropriate status
 * - No exceptions thrown - pure functional style with explicit return values
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Log order start
 * 2. Process payment -> if failed, return early
 * 3. Reserve inventory -> if failed, return early
 * 4. Create shipment
 * 5. Send confirmation
 * 6. Return success status
 *
 * Note: Activities internally use Result/Future pattern, but workflow code
 * stays deterministic by working with the unwrapped values.
